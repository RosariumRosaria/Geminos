## Description:

Centuries ago, a massive shard of crystal fell from the place-above-the-sky, crashing into the pinnacle of a mountain in southern [[Elysia]]. A small group of scholars and adventurers made their way to the crystals peak, where they found themselves changed in subtle ways. 

They dedicated themselves to researching the crystal, finding they could bond and commune with small shards of it. After years the group grew, recruiting locals from [[Aleyrac]], and the original group became the High Conclave, dedicated to reaching further levels of unity with the shard. This also marked the beginning of a slow shift from research to worship, and from secularism to theology. 

Today the order has aborsbed the town of Aleyrac, with the best and brightest being recruited into the order. They become guardians, researchers, priests, and explorers. It is their sacred mission to learn about the world, and to teach their bond-shards, for when they die, their knowledge and soul will live on in the Prime Shard. 

The order has cool but amicable relations with the [[Elysian League]], with it mostly keeping to itself. The order is a foederati, or an aligned nation rather than a constituent member of the league.

## Rituals:

### Ritual of Return
- When a member of the order passes, their Shard is returned to Prime
- This incorporates the sum total of their knowledge, experience, and personality into Prime
- Highly spiritual and emotional, similar to a funeral 
### Ritual of Bonding
- After an initiate finds a shard that they resonate with, they are bound to it
Binding to another person’s shard, or one you don’t resonate with can be disastrous. 
- A more extreme version is practiced by the highest levels of the order in which the shards are implanted
### Ritual of Light
- The oculus above Prime is opened, bathing it in the starlight
- Debated what this does, some say it lets it communicate with something out there, others say it recharges it
- Performed when the stars align in certain ways
- Most of the order partakes, all present resonate with Prime
- Minor variation performed by members with their personal Shards
### Ritual of Guidance
- Prime gives shard bearers quests/callings in attunement ritual
- It’s not a sorting hat it’s a process between the initiate and prime to determine the best fit rather than simply choosing
- Can change between callings, but it’s rare
