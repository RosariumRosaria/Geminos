## Description:

House Albrion is a noble line of [[Castanar]], with claimed ancestry charting their origins as a cadet branch of the [[House Darach]], the ancestral monarchs of Castanar. Of course, this also means that they trace themselves directly back to the [[Lady of the Lake]] themselves, a claim made only slightly less extraordinary by the numerous lords and ladies claiming the same.

They've faithfully served the monarchs for centuries, with the first recorded mention of the house being when a third son of the then Queen of All Castanar was awarded the Duchy of DUCHYNAME after completing a grand oath. To this day, they retain this land as their primary holding.

The current patriarch of House Albrion is [[Duke Colton]], who rules alongside his wife, [[Lady Adalyn]].
