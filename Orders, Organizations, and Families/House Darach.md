## Description:

House Darach has held the title of Queens and Kings of all [[Castanar]] for millennia. They trace a direct lineage back to the first Queen, [[Lady Aisling Darach]], and from her child to the [[Lady of the Lake]]. 

Whenever a King or Queen of all Castanar passes away, one child of House Darach has taken a great Oath given to them as a vision directly from the Lady herself. These quests are often epic in proportion, involving feats of bravery, gallantry, and chivalry of epic proportions. After doing so, they are deemed worthy of wearing the [[Crown of Silver Vines]], granting them great powers and rulership over Castanar.

The Last Queen of All Castanar, [[Lady Ciara]], passed away without an heir in a disastrous skirmish with [[Einhett]]. As such, the line of House Darach has ended. Their lands are currently in the hands of a Regent while matters of succession are decided.
