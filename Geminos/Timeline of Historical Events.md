-  Around 900 years before the founding of Elys (exact date uncertain and apocryphal), the [[Lady of the Lake]] appears and declares a new dynasty. A lowborn who would become the first member of the [[Knights-Errant]] becomes the new ruler following the completion of her oath.
-   Around 130 years before the founding of Elys, the last Batarian Emperor dies heirless, leading to a succession crisis that fractures the empire into numerous states. To this day [[Batari]] lacks a leader. 
-   In the year 1 of the Elysian Calendar, [[Elys]] is founded. According to legend, an Oracle of the [[Twin Goddesses]] and her followers journeyed to the island of [[Salus]] and founded the city after receiving a vision of a great empire springing forth from it.
-   The [[Elysia|Elysian Empire]] collapses, with most historians agreeing that it happens in 1105. The process of decay is long and drawn-out, with provinces breaking away, generals rebelling, and corruption taking hold.
-   In 1445, an order of [[Knights-Errant]] is shipwrecked in what was then a collection of Halfling duchies. The leader of the order strikes a bargain with an upstart noble, and the state that forms from this becomes the nucleus of what is now known as [[Rosaria]].
-   In 1504, the clans of Ratkind convene to broker peace and forge a lasting treaty, uniting the disparate peoples into one union that aims to foster peace and prosperity for all. This union is known as [[Patkana]]
-   In 1532, the Confederation of [[Einhett]] is proclaimed.
-   In 1554, the Coiling Empire of [[Beluir]] falls as a great storm ravages the oceans. The provinces quickly gain freedom.
-  In 1564,  the great storm ends, and [[Farran]] invades the rump state of [[Beluir]]
-  In 1584, a civil war breaks out between the twin princes of [[Arcus]] (Juliae) and [[Mentae]] (Auriae), sparking a succession crisis in the dual monarchy. The war tears apart any remaining unity and reignites a bitter rivalry that continues to this day.
-  In 1589, the hordes of [[Obitarum]] surge forth, possessed by an unnatural intelligence. A joint effort by [[Batari]] and the [[Rose Guard]] is launched to defend the [[Stenmur Gate]].
-  In 1600, the [[Elysian League]] is proclaimed following the liberation/conquest of Elys.
-  In 1602, [[Victoria]] completes her pilgrimage, and eventually creates the Holy State of [[Sanctus]]
- In 1603, the Stenmur Gate falls. A massive undead phoenix breaks through the ancient rune-work, shattering it beyond repair. Hordes surge forth, scattering the beleaguered defenders. Civilians from the region are relocated to safety to attempt to starve the undead of fresh bodies.
- In 1607, the fall of the gate is a rallying cry, with the [[Cerna Guard]] being sent to join the effort. Goliaths, Aryzli, and Dryad fight side by side in a terrible war of attrition. Volunteers from across [[Aureliana]] pour in. In particular a group of fire-shapers from [[Atla]] prove to be brutally effective, leaving little flesh for necromancy to revive.
- In 1623, the crisis is declared over. The undead tide seems to ebb, with the defenders managing to destroy many of the shambling colossi that seemed to lead the hordes. Most of the Rose Guard, Cerna Guard, and other foreign forces return home. To this day however many undead remain in southern Batari.
- In 1624, Clan [[Iszap]] rebels against [[Arzyl]] sparking a brutal civil war that rages for years. (How long exactly?)
-  In 1629, [[Astaria]] steps down from her position as Consul, fearing that the nation she forged would become too reliant on her.
-   Our story begins in 1634.
