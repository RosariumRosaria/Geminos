-  Around 900 years before the founding of Elys (exact date uncertain and apocryphal), the [[Lady of the Lake]] appears and declares a new dynasty after a peasant revolt overthrows the old one. A lowborn [[Knight-Errant]] becomes the new ruler following the completion of her oath.
-   Around 130 years before the founding of Elys, the last Batarian Emperor dies heirless, leading to a succession crisis that fractures the empire into numerous states. To this day [[Batari]] lacks a leader. 
-   In the year 1 of the Elysian Calendar, [[Elys]] is founded. According to legend, an Oracle of the [[Twin Goddesses]] and her followers journeyed to the island of [[Salus]] and founded the city after receiving a vision of a great empire springing forth from it.
-   The [[Elysia|Elysian Empire]] collapses, with most historians agreeing that it happens in 1105. The process of decay is long and drawn-out, with provinces breaking away, generals rebelling, and corruption taking hold.
-   In 1445, an order of [[Knights-Errant]] is shipwrecked in what was then a collection of Halfling duchies. The leader of the order strikes a bargain with an upstart noble, and the state that forms from this becomes the nucleus of what is now known as [[Rosaria]].
-   In 1504, the clans of Ratkind convene to broker peace and forge a lasting treaty, uniting the disparate peoples into one union that aims to foster peace and prosperity for all. This union is known as [[Patkana]]
-   In 1532, the Confederation of [[Einhett]] is proclaimed.
-   In 1554, the Coiling Empire of [[Beluir]] falls as a great storm ravages the oceans. The provinces quickly gain freedom.
-  In 1564,  the great storm ends, and [[Farran]] invades the rump state of [[Beluir]]
-  In 1584, a civil war breaks out between the twin princes of [[Arcus]] (Juliae) and [[Mentae]] (Auriae), sparking a succession crisis in the dual monarchy. The war tears apart any remaining unity and reignites a bitter rivalry that continues to this day.
-  In 1600, the [[Elysian League]] is proclaimed following the liberation/conquest of Elys.
-  In 1602, [[Victoria]] completes her pilgrimage, and eventually creates the Holy State of [[Sanctus]]
-  In 1604, the hordes of [[Obitarum]] surge forth, possessed by an unnatural intelligence. A joint effort by [[Batari]] and the [[Rose Guard]] is launched to defend the [[Stenmur Gate]]. With much life lost, after 10 years it fails.
-  In 1614, the fall of the gate is a rallying cry, with the [[Cerna Guard]] being sent to join the effort. Together after 7 brutal years they manage to weaken the undead, with the remaining  hordes being isolated and disunited. Fighting continues in southern Batari, and the gate remains broken. 
- In 1624, Clan [[Iszap]] rebels against [[Arzyl]] sparking a brutal civil war that rages for years. (How long exactly?)
-  In 1629, [[Astaria]] steps down from her position as Consul, fearing that the nation she forged would become too reliant on her.
-   Our story begins in 1634.
