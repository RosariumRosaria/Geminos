## Description:

A sprawling mountain range in western [[Aewin]], the Southern Spine hosts vast mineral riches. Entirely separated from the dwarvish nations of the north, its caverns host the peoples of the Ratkin and Batkin instead. 

The Batkin are an ancient people, and during their long history, they forged a vaguely unified collection of petty duchies and princedoms. Their aristocratic manors and estates cling to the roofs of the caverns they call home. The Ratkin only rose to prominence recently, with their existence and sentience being either the whims of a trickster god or an experiment gone wrong. That is, at least if you listen to the Batkin. 

The Ratkin, instead, would tell you that they lived beneath the notice of their flying brethren for millennia. They would claim that they and the Batkin were once the same people, with the Batkin forming a covenant with some trickster god to grant them flight. 

Regardless of which story you believe, one true thing is that today the Aristocratic States of the Batkin and the Communal Ratkin are locked in strife.
