## Description:

Though recent wars have brought the city down from the illustrious heights of her past, Elys still is one of the grandest cities in the world. It commands a powerful position on the island of Salus, from which it can launch great fleets and control trade flowing into or out of northern Aewin. 

The city boasts a grand harbor, a massive central palace (Now the grand forum of the [[Elysian League]]), and numerous oracles and temples. However, much of the city is in disrepair as the years have worn heavily on Elys. Her population has shrunk from the massive heights it once enjoyed in the days of [[Elysia]]. Many of her districts have been empty of cities; ancient apartments rot away without people to live in them.

In ancient days it was said that all trade flowed to or from Elys, and from that truth came the saying, "All ships sail for Elys." Today her situation lays somewhat diminished, with the new competitors siphoning much  away from her.
