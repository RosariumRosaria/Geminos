Aleyrac is a small mountain town that is unremarkable in nearly all things. They farm, raise animals, and make small crafts like all other small towns. However, it houses the [[Order of the Starry Night]], a small group of scholars, theologians, and warriors dedicated to worshiping, researching, and rebuilding a massive crystal that crashed into the mountain.

Aleyrac is a small mountain village with sprawling fields for grazing cattle. Near the Order's observatory-temple is a small but vibrant urban community. Many of the locals wear crystals, viewing them as good luck symbols.
