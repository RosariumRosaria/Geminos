## Description:

The Sunken Sands is a remarkable desert, unparalleled in its grandeur and beauty, and is the sole desert in all of [[Geminos]]. Its existence has long been a mystery, with some believing that it was artificially created due to its unique formation. The towering cliff face that surrounds the desert is reminiscent of a massive sinkhole or a fallen star, adding to its mystique.

While it appears desolate, in truth, it is far from lifeless. Massive mechanical dunestrides walk across the sands, and carry with them miniature ecosystems with bizarre ecologies. Great creatures lurk beneath the sands, waiting to strike upon the unwary. And the mesas' serve as revisors of life and water, with them forming the only permanent settlements.

## Visual Description:

The sunken sands are as stunning and awe inspiring as any other sea. Many a traveler has stood slack-jawed at the craters edge, staring off at the sheer enormity of the desert. The Sun's light reflects off each grain of sand, glinting into infinity, with the only things to break up the endless yellow dunes being the massive mesas. 

The mesas themselves are towering stone behemoths, their flat tops serving as an oasis for rare plants and creatures. The wind whistles and whips around the peaks, creating a symphony of howls and moans that echo off the cliffs. The Mesa's are also honeycombed with the homes of the [[Mezari]], bases from which their great dunestriders launch forth.
