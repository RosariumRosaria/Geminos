## Description:

An ancient and storied state, the Elysian Empire united nearly half of [[Aewin]]. While it stood, the region was peaceful, prosperous, and united. 

After centuries of decline, the nation slowly descended into a constellation of petty kingdoms and city-states, with its outlying provinces picked apart by old rivals. 

However, even now, the culture and legacy it forged endure long beyond its downfall.
