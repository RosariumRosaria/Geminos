## Description:

For millennia, the Mezari halflings traveled across the [[Sunken Sands]] in their massive dunestriders. They controlled the only overland route to bridge northern and southern Aewin. This meant that when pirates or great storms made sea trade untenable, only they could provide the hungry markets of the north with the bounty of the southern lands. 

Their way of life was forever changed with the arrival of the Dwarves. A prospector team from the [[Gunpowder Cartel]] was sent out into the desert, hearing tales of fabulous riches and mountains within. They wandered lost, thirsty, and delirious for months before a Mezari caravan took them in. They were taken deeper into the desert, seeking an oasis hidden within the shadow of one of the Great Mesas of the desert.

Once they arrived, however, the Dwarves saw a great opportunity. These Mesas presented a way to establish permanent settlements in the desert as they offered shade, shelter, and hidden deep within their cores, water. Lacking the numbers to settle them on their own, the dwarves taught the ways of mountain life to the native Halflings, who quickly adapted it to their needs. 

A new society flourished, with waves of Dwarvish immigration turning each mesa of the desert into a great city of mixed dwarven and halfling culture. Grand bazaars sell Dwarven metalwork and Halfling crafts. Today the clans are divided into those that have settled into urban life and those that still ply the dune sea, living as their ancestors did.
