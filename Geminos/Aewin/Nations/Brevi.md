## Description:

Brevi's ambitions are not in the conquest of territory but in the collection of wealth. Following the ancient unification of the elven clans of the region, they declared neutrality in all external conflicts. This peace allowed Brevi to focus on internal development. 

Brevian craftsmanship is unmatched, with even simple clothing and tools being breathtaking works of art. The attention to detail, artistry, and quality surpass almost all others worldwide. Thanks to the long lives of the Elves, a single Brevian artisan can have lifetimes of experience. As such, they have acquired great wealth by selling said goods to their neighbors. The nobles and wealthy of other nations are more than willing to pay a considerable markup for products with an Brevian seal of origin.

Their wealth and peace have also afforded them excellent stability, with the old [[Elysia|Elysian Empire]], new [[Elysian League]], [[Castanar]], and [[Beluir]] all being valued customers of the Brevian Mercantile Republic. The Brevians have maintained neutrality by leveraging their economic power and vigorous trade relationships with their neighbors.

Brevi is a unique and prosperous nation that values commerce and craftsmanship above conquest and expansion. Their focus on peace and economic power has allowed them to maintain stability in a region marked by conflict and instability.
