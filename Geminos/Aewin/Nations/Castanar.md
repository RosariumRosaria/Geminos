## Description:

Castanar has long stood as a bulwark of Chivalry on the western coast of [[Aewin]]. Its monarchy derives legitimacy from an alleged descent from the [[Lady of the Lake]], a mythical figure central to the Castanari religion. According to legend, she graced the first Queen of Castnar with a mighty spear to mark her favor and a child to be her heir.

Ever since those days, Castanar has been defended by its [[Knights-Errant]], who swear holy oaths to complete quests to venture to the fae-touched island of [[Virdia]]. A knight who achieves their oath finds themself empowered with the magic and tricks of the Fae. Moreover, they swear to abide by a strict code of Chivalry, which was said to be written by the first member of the Knight-Errant.

Thanks to said knights, Castanar has enjoyed stability for hundreds of years. Her peasants are healthy and well-fed, and her cities are large and prosperous. However, thanks to that stability and a rigid caste system, Castanar has also not experienced innovation technologically or culturally at nearly the rate of its neighbors. Her fields are still tilled in the same manner they always have been, her warriors fight with the same weapons, and her scholars read the same texts of more glorious times. This has led to a stagnancy in Castanar, with her neighbors changing and advancing while she falls ever further behind. 

However, recent years have shattered the stability and isolation of Castanar that allowed it to remain so peaceful and relatively backward. The transformation of the Orcs to their south from a collection of raiders to the unified state of [[Einhett]] Castanar faces a new rival. Much of the southern frontier is now lost to the warriors of [[Einhett]], and many of her Knights-Errant are perish, attempting vainglorious oath quests to reclaim it.

With the old queen of Castanar dying heirless, the laws of succession called for the [[Lady of the Lake]] to appoint a new leader. This ancient rite has not been invoked since the founding of Castanar in ancient times. However, with the Lady not seen for millennia, the throne remains empty, and the enemies of Castanar threaten the borders on all sides.

## Cultural Regions:

Literal millennia of relative stability and cultural exchange has led to Castanar being a mostly homogonous region, with all those in the kingdom thinking of themselves as Castanari first and foremost. However that does not mean that the kingdom is a true monolith as traces of pre-Castanari culture still exist to this day. 

Quintessential Castanari culture is best exhibited the lands of [[House Darach]] along with the other houses of central Castanar. Many of these houses either are ancient cadet branches of the royal line itself, or claim some lineage from the original followers of [[Lady Adalyn]]. Due to its predominant status, this is dubbed High-Castanari.
