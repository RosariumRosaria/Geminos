## Description:

Before the League's founding, the Elysia proper region was a smattering of democratic city-states, minor nobles, countless bandits, and a few larger kingdoms. Each city claimed it was the heir of [[Elysia|Elysian Empire]], but none could bring the unity and peace it did.

That was until the birth of [[Astaria]], some 34 years ago. Born to a humble family, she led a popular revolution in the minor city-state she called home. After winning a few short wars against neighboring states, Astaria's idealism and populist appeal managed to win the adoration of many of the democratic city-states that made up the region. 

Calling upon their shared [[Elysia|Elysian]] heritage and the threat of an aristocratic backlash from the larger kingdoms to the North, she untied them into the Elysian League. Recently the League managed a stunning naval campaign that won them new lands, including the old capital of the Elysian empire, the grand city of [[Elys]]. 

With the prestige and legitimacy this brought her fledgling state, she transformed a loose coalition of cities into a grand and unified republic. Today the towns prosper; Freed from unjust taxes from nobles, the people can innovate and build. Where once bandits stopped any actual trade from occurring, today, cooperation can flourish. Resources, people, and money flow across the League.

Towns that were shells of their former selves have begun to repopulate. Even the great megastructures of the old empire are rebuilt. Ancient aqueducts are patched, old walls are repaired, and schools and hospitals open up across the League. Even the palaces of the nobles are appropriated and convereted into hospitials and schools.

However, with Consul Astaria announcing her withdrawal from politics and stepping down as Consul, Elysia is entering a period of turbulence and uncertainty. She has been the guiding hand of the League since its inception. From leading the legions to leading the Senate, Astaria always ensured success. However, it is yet to be seen if the state she founded can survive without her.
