## Description:

The peoples of the swamplands are as varied as any; Grung, Orc, Goblin, and Centaur all call them home. The one thing that unites them is their long-suffering at the hands of the [[Knights-Errant]] of [[Castanar]]. Those knights took it upon themselves to defend their borderlands from raids and incursionsâ€¦ by raiding the swamps in turn. 

History is unsure who actually struck the first blow.

This all changed following the Hobgoblin migration. Previously the Hobgoblins kept to the mountains, living in their insular mountain top villages. It's unknown to the world at large what caused them to journey south into the marshes that would become Einhett. It is, however, known what happened next.

Hobgoblin culture prided itself on unity, marshal strength, and discipline. Upon reaching the marshes, they began a campaign of consolidation. One by one, the other peoples they found there were brought into the fold. They were promised safety, more than just protection; the Hobgoblins vowed to teach them how to protect themselves. The Hobgoblins refined the natural strengths of each culture, turning them into formidable warriors.

Almost overnight, the marsh was transformed from a scattering of villages into a unified state, the Confederation of Einhett.  No more would they sit idly by when Castnari knights went questing into their homelands. Now they would fight back tooth and claw.
