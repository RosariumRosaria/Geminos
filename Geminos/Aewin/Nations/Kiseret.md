## Description:

Kiseret is less of a singular state and more of a constellation of minor fiefdoms and upstart princedoms that nominally make up one polity. However, their supposed unity has never stopped them from quarreling and bickering.

The Batkin of Kiseret have turned the uniquely massive stalactites of the [[ Southern Spine]] into their home. Palaces, estates, farms, and even cities all cling to the roof of those caverns. This has led to a unique culture and architectural style, with numerous innovations required for living on the cavern ceiling. From their hanging gardens to reverse spires, the lands of Kiseret host many a wonder.

The Princes of Kiseret are also well-known patrons of the arts. Their halls often have glittering gemstone mosaics, beautiful stone sculptures, and lush fungal gardens. In addition to physical works, they are renowned for their love of music. Their biological adaptation of echolocation lends them an enhanced sense of hearing. As such, the bards of Kiseret are well known for their legendary performances. They also are great suppliers of raw resources, with iron, copper, and gems all abundant in their cavernous homes. Both [[Castanar]] and the [[Mezari]] rely on Kiesreti resources to fuel their economies. 

Kiseret has an ancient and storied history, and its people are proud of it. Dynasties of Batkin often trace their roots back to ancient history, with a heavy emphasis on the glory of one's family. But, unfortunately, this legacy has led to the state stagnating, with many a prince fighting over old grudges or priding themselves over their ancestors' accomplishments. Often a Princeling will cite a slight or heritage older than some surface kingdoms as a reason to claim another's throne.

Kiseret is locked in conflict with [[Patkana]]. The official doctrine of Kiseret is that the Batkin are a new race, with their existence and sentience being either the whims of a trickster god or an experiment gone wrong. While the origins of the fighting were lost to time, it continues into the modern day due to ideology. Furthermore, the communal way of life of the Ratkin threatens the aristocratic leanings of the Batkin, with peasants and serfs joining the rats below. 

While the vertical distance stops the war from being more than a series of raids, some reports claim that Ratkin science is close to creating flying machines to turn the tides of the battle. This is in stark contrast to the Batkin, who are often hesitant to embrace change.
