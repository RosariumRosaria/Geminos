## Description:

One of the only Dwarvish states in [[Aewin]], the semi-unified clans of the Gunpowder Cartel maintain a stranglehold on their namesake, gunpowder. They are the sole provider of gunpowder in all of Aewin, with the armies of all Elysia, Mentae, [[Arcus]], and numerous others relying on them to fuel their weapons.

The Dwarves arrived in Aewin after being invited by a particularly ambitious [[Elysia|Elysian]] emperor. They quickly settled into the mountains. They began life as a small outpost of only a few hundred dwarves, with successive waves of would-be colonizers coming after hearing tales of immense wealth and new land. 

After integrating well into Elysian culture, the clans found wealth by providing arms to the legions. Soon the dwarves of the Cartel were a common sight throughout the empire, filling roles ranging from soldiers to accountants. They even secured the rights and legal protections of a proper imperial province.

Following the empire's collapse, the Cartel became an independent state. While this seemed a catastrophic event at first, with their protector and largest consumer gone, it was actually a blessing. Thanks to the wars and strife that are now ubiquitous, the Cartel grows ever more decadent. As a rule, the Cartel would never take sides in combat, preferring to stay officially neutral. However, that doesn't stop them from selling weapons to both sides and pocketing double the returns.

The gilded halls of the Cartel honeycomb the mountain range they call home. They have found immense riches by unearthing new resources buried beneath the earth and selling them for a tidy profit.
