## Description:

Beneath the palaces of the [[Kiseret]] on the cavern floor of the [[Southern Spine]] sits the Commune of Patkana. While the Batkin were blessed with flight, the Ratkin (Or, more formally, Patkany) were blessed with an innovative spirit. As a result, many a Patkana clansmen have risked their lives upon some inane invention, with roughly equal amounts of succeeded and failed attempts. 

Patkany formed after a long and bloody war ravaged the Patkany. As part of the peace agreement, numerous clans united for the common good of all ratkind. Pooling their resources, technology, and ratpower, they began to progress.

Today the Patkany live in unity. Each clan works in harmony towards the common good. Inventions and resources that once only benefited one clan now help the collective. This has led to a massive increase in the quality of life and a swelling in population. While once the Patkany were forced to scurry about avoiding Kisereti raids, now they dwell in massive under cities, which boast food and shelter for all. 

Official Patkany records differ on the start of the war with Denever. Some claim it was a glorious attempt to spread unity; others say it was in defense after a Batkin raid. Regardless, sporadic conflict continues to this day.

Ancient legends, however, tell a different story. They would say they lived beneath the notice of their flying brethren for millennia. They would claim that they and the Batkin were once the same people, with the Batkin forming a covenant with some trickster god to grant them flight. And that the modern war is to punish them for that dark covenant.
