## Description:

Mentae arose from an old province of the [[Elysia|Elysian Empire]], which like many others, became independent kingdoms. 

Mentae was a center for learning and hosted numerous scholastic orders and academies. The greatest was [[The Circle]], a renowned college dedicated to pursuing the arcane. [[The Circle]] consists of multiple campuses devoted to studying the various arcane arts. Everything from lithomancy to pyromancy is being taught in its halls. [[The Circle]] actually predates the Elysian Empire, with it's founding being the work of the local Owlin population. 

Even some magics that many other lands consider less than savory are taught and normalized, with  [[The Circle]] having a campus dedicated to Necromancy. It's not an uncommon sight to see a student followed by a trail of skeletons and familiars helping them carry their books.

While technically still following the pantheon of the [[Old Faith]], Mentae has almost developed a monotheistic religion focused on the deity of knowledge. The deity of knowledge is another hold over from the native Owlin, who after being assimalted into the empire found their religion meshed with that the [[Old Faith]]. Other gods are frowned upon but not politically restricted. Some skeptics even deny the existence of any gods, arguing that any higher powers are merely more advanced forms of life or some arcane font of power.

A few centuries ago, after an unlikely marriage between the Grand Duchess of [[Arcus]] and the King-Enchanter of Mentae, the two became the Dual monarchy of [[Arcus]]-Mentae. This was a remarkable period of cultural and economic flourishing, with the unique combination of religious zeal and academic intellect proving a potent pair. However, what the bonds of love forged, ideology slowly wore away. 

Two twin princes, one raised in [[Arcus]] ([[Juliae]]) and the other in Mentae ([[Auriae]]), tore apart any remaining unity in a succession crisis some 50 years ago. This sparked a brutal civil war, which left each kingdom broken and weary, with many works of art and architecture being destroyed in the fighting.

When the dust had settled, each prince sat upon the throne of their home kingdom. But, unfortunately, their dispute had reignited a bitter rivalry. To this day, they remain locked in a long war that ravages the lands of both.
