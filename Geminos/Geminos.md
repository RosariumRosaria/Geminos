## Description:

The continents of [[Aewin]] and [[Aureliana]], along with the Islands of [[Ellanor]] in between, are known as Geminos. They've seen the rise and fall of countless peoples and empires. 

With a storied history stretching back into ancient fables of the [[Twin Goddesses]] that give [[Aewin]] and [[Aureliana]] their names, the lands of Geminos have seen everything from prosperous unity to calamitous collapse. Those Twin goddess also gave Geminos its more affectionate nickname, "The Twins"

Recent years have heralded the start of a new era, with ancient kingdoms shaken to their foundations, long-running wars reaching new feverous heights, and new nations forged through fire, steel, and faith.
