## Description:

Aureliana is the northern of the Twins, and is a far harsher place than her southern sister. Apart from a small region warmed by the sea on her southern coast she is a frigid and hostile place. Much the continent is dominated by a massive mountain range known as the [[Northern Spine]],.
