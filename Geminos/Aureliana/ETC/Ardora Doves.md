## Description:

Ardora, also known as Ember-Doves or Phoenix Chicks: A small bird native to [[Sanctus]] (Although some breeds range as far as [[Batari]]).
 
They are highly valued in [[Sanctus]] both as pets but also as messengers. The Churches of [[Concordia]] entrust missives to Ardora doves when they lack the priestess to send them through divine means.

Their feathers are also considered to be tokens of good luck, and contain magical properties. This led to a practive of farming them to sell to wealthy foreign wizards, which was outlawed following the rise of [[Sanctus]] due to their association with the Phoenix avatars she sometimes takes.

## Visual Traits:

 Ardora are well known for their vibrant plumage, with feathers ranging from from brilliant reds to soft amber golds. They gained their name both from the aforementioned vibrance of their colors, but also from their unique eggs. 
 
 They sport shells of a dark charcoal black, with specks of red, gold, and orange. As the egg matures this specks will grow, overtaking the black of the shell, eventually leading to a stunning collage said to resemble the rebirth of Phoenix.
