## Description:

The Stenmur Gate was a massive stone wall erected by ancient Dwarven rune smiths in coalition with a group of Batari shamans. Each stone in the gate was inscribed with warding, sealing, and binding runes. It was created to hold back the lands of Obitarum and to ensure that the dead remained within its confines.

In recent years the gate has been broken through unknown means, which granted the dead of Obitarum access to both the lands of the Northern Spine, and to [[Batari]].

## Visual Description:

A massive stone wall sealing the entrance into the [[Northern Spine]], which now stands shattered by undead hands. A huge gouge was torn into its center, with the edges of the gash melted into slag.
