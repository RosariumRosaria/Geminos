## Description:

The Stenmur Gate was a massive wall of stone and ice erected by ancient Dwarven rune smiths in coalition with a group of Batari shamans. Each stone in the gate was inscribed with warding, sealing, and binding runes by the Dwarves. While the ice contained trapped light from the Auroras' that danced in the night, that was anathema to the undead. It was created to hold back the lands of Obitarum and to ensure that the dead remained within its confines.

In recent years the gate has been broken through unknown means, which granted the dead of Obitarum access to both the lands of the Northern Spine, and to [[Batari]].

## Visual Description:

A massive stone and ice wall sealing the entrance into the [[Northern Spine]], which now stands shattered by undead hands. Once, every brick sung with inscribed runes, and within the ice the Aurora's light danced. A huge gouge was torn into its center, with the edges of the gash melted into slag.
