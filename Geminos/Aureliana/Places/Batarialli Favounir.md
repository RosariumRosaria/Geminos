## Description:

Batarialli Favounir (Literally translating to Clan of [[Favouna]] in Batari) was once a small village in southern [[Batari]]. The name Favonuir is taken from an ancient Batari warrior from tales that are half myth and half history. She led the clan to the spot that would become their home and was their first chief. The town was near the [[Stenmur Gate]], which held back the undead that threatened the land. As one of the tribes entrusted with the sacred duty of protecting the gate, the people of Favounir contributed hardy warriors to guard over it.

However, this all changed in 1603 when an undead phoenix, its skin blackened and decayed, and feathers constantly molting and regrowing, burned through the Stenmur Gate in a blaze of sickly light. After that, the undead poured through the gap, slaughtering the defenders. Eventually, they even reached Favounir. 

The invasion forced a hurried migration, with the people of Favounir relocating to a mountain farther north, hoping to stay safe from the hordes. This was a long and arduous journey, and the transition to mountain-top living was more challenging still. The human population has the worst of it, being ill-suited to the thin frigid air of the mountain. Unfortunately, this was only partially successful, with groups of undead occasionally reaching even their isolated home. While the local clans know they relocated, many of their old trading partners thought they were destroyed along with the gate.

Today, the town has adjusted to its new home well, with the younger generations have never known their ancestral home. However, everyone carries the hope to return to their old home in their hearts. The town is a close-knit community, with the people being more than willing to help each other through hardships. The bonds forged by shared suffering are strong, and they know they are stronger together. Each member is expected to strive for the collective good, with those who don't contribute being exiled until they learn to.

A chief governs the town, but much of the power is held democratically, with most issues being put to the vote. Children are given one vote, adults two, leaders, both spiritual and secular, have three, and the chief has four.

Somewhat uniquely for a Batari village, Favounir hosts a temple dedicated to [[Concordia]], with [[Helia]] introducing them to the religion following her induction as a cleric. Much of the clan has added the goddess to their prayers, although few, if any, have given up the old gods of the [[Lys Auralis]].
