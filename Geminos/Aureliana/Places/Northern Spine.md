## Description:

The Northern Spine is a massive mountain range that stretches across all of [[Aureliana]], bisecting the continent into a frigid north and somewhat more temperate south. Her peaks are more prominent, harsher, and colder than anything that [[Aewin]] or [[Ellanor]] holds. 

And within those towering mountains, there exists a world onto itself. The Dwarves have set up sprawling holds throughout the length of the spine, with their massive edifices of stone and gold housing untold numbers. Some trade intimately with the outside world, with resources and dwarvish products being traded for commodities that are hard to find inside the mountains. Others fight against them, with one clan engaged in a bitter war with [[Sanctus]], with some holds already falling to the theocratic state.

There are other peoples within the caverns as well, with the Kobolds of [[Calor]] fighting to claim a new home for themselves, as something has caused the magma pools that they called home to grow cold and dead. And yet still stranger beings exist, with odd creatures and malign presences in the deepest depths.
