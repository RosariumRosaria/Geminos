## Description:

Clan [[Skala]] is young, vibrant, and still finding it's place in the world. And the city that forms its beating heart reflects all of those qualities.  The city was only recently founded, with construction beginning as a military fortifaction during the rebellion. Civilians flocked to the fortress in droves, seeking the supplies and stability that the imperial army offered. 

Skala sits straddling one of the numerous large lakes of [[Arzyl]], with a large dockyard bustling with merchants and fishermen. Her streets are lined with merchants, vendors, and performers offering food, goods, and entertainment (Although, the plague has put a damper on trade). However, the recent outbreak of a plague has put a damper on trade, and the city's inhabitants are doing their best to weather the storm.

The region is well known of the use of the spice [[Orvoss (Herb)]], which imparts a unique taste in food, a subtlety sweet and hot spice that is known as a delicacy. 

It boasts a sweeping wall dotted with watchtowers, as raids from the remnants of Clan [[Iszap]] still occur with some regularity. Along that wall are numerous soldiers of the city guard, as the Clan's previous incarnation as a mercenary company has given it a martial temperament. 

Skala is a city of faith, and innumerable temples dedicated to the gods of the Arzyli pantheon can be found throughout the city. The healing goddess [[Orvoss]] and the martial deity [[Azyar]] have particularly ornate cathedrals near the city center, attracting many followers seeking their favor.
