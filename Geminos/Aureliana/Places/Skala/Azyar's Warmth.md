## Description:

Azyar's Warmth is a beloved tavern, run by [[Varadi Okval]]. The owner is a [[Arzyli]] of the lineage of [[Azyar]], and uses her natural gifts well. Her tolerance to heat, and ability to breathe fire is of great use in the tavern. Food is served steaming hot, with Varadi being more than happy to cook it table side for a nominal fee.

Varadi is known for insisting that she had the idea first and that her competitor/spouse, [[Kirlay Timea]] is simply a bitter loser.
