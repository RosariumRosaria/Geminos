## Description:

Orvoss' Breath is a tavern that's developed quite a reputation despite it's recent founding. It's founder, [[Kirlay Timea]] is a [[Arzyli]] of the lineage of [[Orvoss]], and as such sports her ice-cold breath. They use this to chill drinks to frosty perfection which is a popular novelty. 

Her Spouse, [[Varadi Okval]] runs a similar tavern known as [[Azyar's Warmth]], where uses her breath to heat and cook food. This has encouraged a friendly rivalry between the partners, with each insisting they thought of the idea first.
