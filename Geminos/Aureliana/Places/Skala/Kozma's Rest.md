## Description:

Kozma's Rest is unique in [[Skala (City)]], for predating both the clan and city (A fact the owner [[Kozma]] is quite proud of). It was originally a farmstead, which occasionally hosted travelers in the spare rooms. In recent years instead it has  been converted to primarily be a bed and breakfast.
