## Description:

Until recently, the region known as Sanctus was a desolate and strife-filled backwater. Minor bandit kings and squabbling nobles ruled over impoverished and overworked peasants. That is until the arrival of the first Living Saint, [[Victoria]]. 

Once a simple peasant girl, a vision from a new goddess named [[Concordia]] sent her on a pilgrimage to the scarred lands of [[Obitarum]]. Following a long and perilous journey, she proved her faith and achieved Sainthood. It is said that a single passing touch of her hand could cure even the most gruesome of illnesses. Upon her return, kings, peasants, and many others flocked to her banner and converted to her faith. Her reign brought unity, both in religion and purpose. Today many others have followed in her footsteps, joining her to rise as [[Living Saints]] of Concordia. 

While at first her followers were a collection of a ragtag collection of peasant converts and a few minor lords they soon blossomed into a proper state. Then, Victoria began to receive visions from Concordia, which detailed how her flock should organize themselves. These rules and strictures formed the bedrock of what would become Sanctus' law code.

The newly founded nation of Sanctus has quickly begun to prosper. The saints and priests of Concordia are gifted with healing and curing the diseases and plagues that used to ravage the landscape. As such, a booming population has led to new towns and cities sprouting across the land.

Each town is founded around a central church, where a local clergy member might dispense healing and guidance. In addition, the cities boast massive cathedral complexes that contain hospitals and prayer halls, and the greatest ones even house the Living Saints themselves.

However, with not all willing to submit to the Goddess willingly and a rising surge of undead hordes in Obitarum making the creation of new Living Saints far more perilous, the Kingdom of Sanctus' meteoric rise is challenged for the first time.
