## Description:

Long have the northern reaches of [[Aureliana]] been the home of the Goliaths of Bartari, a proud and noble people. They inhabit the frigid and harsh lands of the far north beneath the dancing lights of the stars.

While technically a united Empire, they’ve lacked an Emperor for longer than history cares to remember. As such, they’ve learned to operate locally, allowing individual clans and families to act in their interests.  This has led to a diversty in culture and ways of living among the clans, with everything from traditional nomads in the mountains, to a rise in the great cities along the coast.

However, this disunity hasn’t dampened their prosperity; from renowned frost-forged blades to the furs and tusks of the creatures they hunt to the ales that would put most other peoples into an early grave, Bartarin goods are sought the world over. 

Recent days have not been so kind to Bartari with the rise of [[Sanctus]] to the east, the blighted hordes of [[Obitarum]] gnawing ever closer to the south, and the [[Northern Spine]] facing turbulence and chaos. In a world filled with threats, some call for a new Emperor to unify the clans. 

The dangers of Obitarum has grown far greater in recent years, with the fall of the [[Stenmur Gate]] the undead have been able to flow into Southern Batari. A coalition of clans has come together to try and push them back, with frost-forged blades being put to use against rotten flesh.

The Batari Conclave is divided between various claimaints, along with a hard-line conserative faction attempting to maintain the status quo. This tension has splintered the Batari, with each group staunchly opposing any compromise.
