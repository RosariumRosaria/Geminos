## Description:

Atla is not a conventional kingdom, dictatorship, republic, aristocracy, or even nation. Instead, it is a culture or way of life. The people of Atla are not governed by a central authority but rather by the community around them.

While Atla welcomes people of all backgrounds, it is primarily inhabited by Genasi. These individuals can uniquely align themselves with an element, gaining its associated strengths, weaknesses, and characteristics. For example, an Earth-aligned Genasi might become a builder or farmer, while a Fire-aligned Genasi could become a warrior or hunter. Air-aligned Genasi may become scouts and rescuers or have the ability to control the weather, while Water-aligned Genasi may specialize in fishing, sailing, or healing.

Atla does not have a caste system but instead encourages Genasi children to explore and learn from all elemental clans. Then, when they are ready, they participate in a great ritual that binds them to an element, transforming their form and granting them new abilities. While most take part in this ritual at 16, some do so earlier if conditions are right. Others wait till later in life should they be uncertain.

However, Atla is not without its flaws. Genasi who refuse to align themselves with an element may face ridicule, condescension, and even hatred from the community.
