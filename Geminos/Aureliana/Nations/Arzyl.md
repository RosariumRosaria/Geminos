## Description:

Arzyl sits on the southern coast of [[Aureliana]], where it is warmed by the currents of [[Ellanor]]. Combined with the network of lakes that crisscross it, Arzyl is far warmer than much of the continent. Moreover, each of those lakes is surrounded by a city that holds one of the Arzyli Clans. 

Arzyli's history is filled with internecine squabbling, with each clan vying for power and influence. For much of time, this took the form of raids, wars, and cold Arzyli blood flowing aplenty. However, this changed when one clan managed to subjugate all the others, forging an empire through subterfuge and trickery.

Unification did little to stop the feuds; however, far from it, the imperial line encouraged them to ensure no other clan could grow to become a threat. Often an alliance of two families will break apart when an imperial courtier whispers little poisons into the eyes of one of the chieftains. Today at least, the feuds take the form of embargos, assassinations, and political denouncements than an actual war.

The Arzyli are industrious, with their craftsmanship and smithing being desired across the [[Geminos|Twins]]. In particular, Arzyli steel surpasses perhaps all others, with it being more robust and flexible than any other. In addition, the metal is well known for holding a sharper edge for longer and for a unique warbled appearance.

Despite its internal issues (or perhaps because of them), Arzyl is immensely loved by its neighbors. It engages in intimate and profitable trade with much of the world. In particular, wine and food from [[Rosaria]] flow into Arzyl in exchange for metal and the unique fertilizer only found in Arzyl. Arzyli mercenaries also often serve in the armies of other nations. 

The greatest of all those companies is the emperor's own [[Cerna Guard]]. The sight of the Cernan black armor arrayed on the battlefield has caused more than one army to rout without a fight. The official imperial policy is to rent them out to allies, offering special rates if deployed against enemies. 

Nearly the entirety of the guard, every company saves the first that protects the emperor, was recently deployed after the [[Sanctus]]-[[Tarcza]] war. This was remarkable on its own but far more so given that they did not accept payment for their work. Instead, the emperor provided their services as a gift to keep Tarcza standing and serve as a buffer state between Arzyl and Sanctus.
