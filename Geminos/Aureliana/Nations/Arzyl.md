## Description:

Orvoss, the goddess of medicine, is revered by the people of [[Arzyl]] as a protector of health and wellbeing. According to legend, Orvoss was born from the  waters of the southern lakes. She is depicted as a shimmering figure, her scales reflecting the light of the sun, with healing herbs and medicines in her hands.

Orvoss is believed to have gifted the Arzyli people with the knowledge of medicine and healing. The Arzyli attribute their advanced knowledge of medicine and surgery to the blessings of Orvoss. In particular a potent healing herb bears her name ([[Orvoss (Herb)]]) Many of the clans host grand temple-complexes dedicated to her, that also serve as houses of healing.

The goddess is also revered for her ability to protect against disease and illness. Her followers believe that by invoking her name and blessings, they can ward off sickness and remain healthy. It is said that those who receive her's blessings will be able to withstand even the deadliest of epidemics.
