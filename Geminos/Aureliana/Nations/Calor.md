## Description:


The Kobolds of Calor have flourished far beneath the halls and holds of the Dwarves.  They built a unique lifestyle that relied on the flow of molten rock to do everything to fuel their industry to heat their homes. However, the Kobolds were forced to venture out of their homes when the pools ran cold. 

One group followed their prophet south to the Shattered Isles, abandoning their traditional homeland to search for a promised land. This led to them a newborn volcano on the easternmost island of the [[Shattered Isles]]. They christened it [[Hartatti]] and appended its name to their own. In its warmth, they prospered until a resurgent tribe of the Grung sought to reclaim the volcano that was once the site of their home city.  

Those that remained in the [[Northern Spine]] found themselves rapidly forced further and further from their traditional home. They had to delve deeper into the mountains to find the few remaining active flows. Or they could move further up, where they ran into a hostile and well-entrenched network of Dwarven holds. 

Today Calor is a nebulous term, with three main branches of Kobolds remaining. Those who are locked into war with the dwarves to try and secure a home for themselves, those who have fled to the oceans to Hartatti, and those who went deeper into the caves and found strange and dark things living there.
