## Description:

Paktt Skydda (Or, in Elysian Standard, "Clan/Paktt Guardians"), is a dwarven clan located near the [[Stenmur Gate]]. In fact along with clans of [[Batari]] (such as [[Batarialli Favounir]]) the ancestors of Paktt Skydda forged it. It is the knowledge and skills of the very rune-smiths who forged inscribed the stones of the gate that has been passed down to the Skyddan clan today. 

Their Hold of [[Halla Skydda]] is a massive fortress and marvel of engineering. The hold is carved into the tunnels of the [[Northern Spine]], with traps, walls, guards riding atop , and rune-constructs protecting the borders. These defenses have been put to the test after the undead surged into the mountains when the Gate fell. Only a constant effort from all of Paktt Skydda keeps the city safe. 

It is not only the defenses of the clan that are so impressive, the hold is also a work of art. Many of the tunnels and halls are decorated with intricate and ornate carvings depicting ancient history or mythology. Visitors often find themselves awestruck by the sheer scale of these works.

While Paktt Skydda keeps on friendly terms with most its neighbors, their closest ally is Favounir. The two peoples are bonded closely by their shared duty to defend the Gate and by trade of ideas, goods, and people. Skydda even took on a large number of Goliath refuges that live in the hold to this day. This also has led to a small minority of Skydda converting to the [[Concord Dawn]], a faith they picked up from Favounir. 

Skydda is ruled by a high-council, with council members representing different segments of society. The clergy, artificers, rune-smiths, historians, farmers, and soldiers all have a certain allotment of seats on the council, with each group holding their own elections. Each group is viewed an equally necessary for the survival of the hold. This ideal of equality is also present in the clan's treatment of women and outsiders, with anyone welcome as long as the contribute.
