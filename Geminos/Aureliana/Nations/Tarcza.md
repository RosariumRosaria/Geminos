## Description:

Tarcza is a strange nation with a contradiction at it's core. with the majority of the middle class consisting of craftsmen, artisans, teachers, governors, minor officials, and landowners. However, what makes Tarcza stand out is the presence of the "Marca," or "The Marked," in their society. These individuals, often referred to as Tieflings in other nations, come from all races and make up both the extreme low and high of Tarczan society.

On one hand, the Marca work as laborers, cleaners, servants, and mage-fodder for the army, earning them the title of "Redus" or "The Low." On the other hand, the Marca also make up the highest echelons of society, including religious leaders, military commanders, and even the ruling dynasty, known as "Pentitia" or "The Penitents." The traits of the Marca manifest in various infernal aspects, such as horns, forked tongues, black eyes, discolored skin, or wings, leading some to believe they are descended from devils or demons.

Generally the traits of the Marca manifest themselves in a somewhat demonic appearance, anything from curling horns, forked tongues, solid black eyes, discolored skin, wings, or other infernal aspects. This has led to the popular theory that they are descended from devils and demons. 

The religion of Tarcza centers around a chosen few families that were meant to lead the world into eternal salvation, but instead nearly brought about the apocalypse. These families became the Marca, who were cursed with their new demonic appearance. The Pentitia being those who underwent a process of purification, and now work to bring about the promised miracle. 

In recent years, numerous Redus have fled to [[Sanctus]], where they are promised freedom persecution and equality under [[Concordia]]. In fact, this sparked the Tarcza-Sanctus war, as numerous Redus converts urged Concordia to attempt to liberate their kin.
