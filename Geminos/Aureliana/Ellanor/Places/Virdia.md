## Description:

Virdia, or the Fae-Touched Isle, is a verdant and lush land sitting close off the coast of [[Castanar]]. The primal island is home to the Fae, with everything from faeries to hags populating its shores. It is said some enchantment is cast across Virdia, for on it tastes are richer, colors brighter, and shadows darker. Those who return from Virdia often find themselves struck with melancholy as the outside world feels like a pale imitation in comparison.

The esteemed [[Knights-Errant]] of [[Castanar]] take up oath-bound quests to venture to Virdia and complete some near-impossible task. This could be anything from slaying a dragon to saving an Eladrin princess to returning some lost relic of antiquity. The tradition of questing to Virdia is ancient, with some saying the [[Lady of the Lake]] herself called the island her home once. Some even say her birth is what caused the island to become the home of the fae.

Most others avoid the shores of Virdia, with many a sailor's tale telling of the fools who wandered too close. Beautiful sirens lurk upon her inviting shores, with glamors making treacherous reefs appear to be inviting natural harbors. And once landing it is hardly any safer, with a thousand tricks and traps waiting for the unprepared.

However, should one manage to manage to surivive, and even thrive upon the island, they can find incredible blessings, from antique magical artifacts to fonts of youth. Some even make pacts with the fae to be granted great boons.
