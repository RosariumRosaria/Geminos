## Description:

Nylus is in many ways the opposite of [[Virdia]] and, in many others, her twisted sister. While in Virdia, your senses are heightened to hedonistic bliss, in Nylus, they are sharpened to bring dismal isle into better relief. The land is nearly barren, with dusky gray earth and sparse stubborn vegetation. It's also terribly flat, with little scenery beyond dust. Flat, except for a single towering cluster of mountains huddling together in the island's center. 

The humans and elves who populate the island have been changed by it, with their skin pallid pales or deep greys and their eyes cold and distant. This has also granted them some eldritch power, with many able to commune with shades or resistant necrotic energies. These can range wildly, with different families often breeding unique capabilities. Warriors of Nylus might fight using skeletal hordes, or blades of pure psychic might, while her spies and diplomats might peer into the mind's deeps. However, this has made them somewhat of an international pariah, with outsiders not trusting them.  

Many a scholar has asked why Nylus is such an odd place, so divorced from the nature of the world. To this day, only theologians and myths have answers.

Unlike Virdia, Nylus holds a unified state, with a single great city as its capital. Rather than being ruled by a monarch or democracy, Nylus is governed by competing bloodlines of shade-sorcerers, necromancers, and psychic exemplars competing, with the fittest taking higher positions in the conclave.

Once, the empire of [[Beluir]] held Nylus as a colony, enforcing a strict military rule. Stories still speak of the strangely bloodless conquest of the island, with the leading hierarchs of Nylus agreeing to annexation without a fight. The emperor of [[Beluir]] was well known for their Nylan courtiers, serving as spies to peer into thoughts or guardians against unnatural attacks. After the fall, Nylus quickly established herself, seizing the land north of [[Vellig]] as her own, although the purposes of which have yet to be discovered.
