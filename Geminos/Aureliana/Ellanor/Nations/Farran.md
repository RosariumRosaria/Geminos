## Description:

Rising straight from the sea, Farran is unique. Lacking the shores and flat land of any other civilization, Farran consists of a cluster of several towering stone pinnacles. Farran's people are also notable, entirely composed of winged species, primarily of Avian descent. 

This has led to an equally unique way of life for the people of Farran, with their city honeycombing the mountainsides and awnings leaning out over the abyssal drop into the water. Only recently were stairs put up around the island to allow outsiders to live among them. 

The city of Farran is said to be breathtaking, with beautiful houses carved straight into cliffs and gorgeous waterfalls pouring off the sides from channeled aqueducts. Statues are also chiseled into the rock, with great heroes immortalized forever there.

Farran sat quietly, living its isolated life, with the people subsisting off fish and kelp harvested in great swooping hunts from the ocean surrounding the island. That was until [[Beluir]] launched an invasion in its consolidation of oceans. It was a strange siege but a brutal one. With Beluirian troops entirely unable to enter the mountains of Farran, they blockaded it with their great ships. Thousands would starve before the inevitable surrender. 

Farran's fortunes would turn recently; however, with the collapse of the Coiling Empire came liberty. Swiftly installing the token force of imperial guard placed upon them, the Farranese quickly regained their statehood. On that momentous day from the island's highest peak, the Second Farranese conclave was proclaimed.

They even went one step further, striking when the moment was right to launch an incursion into Beluir proper. The conclave stated it was not an act of revenge but a mission to keep the peace and stop any would-be conquerer from rising to return Farran to oppression. Still, the war was brutal, with massive casualties on both sides.

Today Farran controls half of Beluir and is engaged in a rapid arms race with the remainder.
