| [[Sanctus]]          | Aureliana | The newly founded nation of Sanctus has quickly begun to prosper. The saints and priests of Concordia are gifted with healing and curing the diseases and plagues that used to ravage the landscape. As such, a booming population has led to new towns and cities sprouting across the land.                                                                                                                                                                             |
| [[Rosaria]]          | Aureliana | Founded by a Knight-Errant of Castanar when an unexpected northern wind blew her ship far off course, Rosaria is an odd fusion of Castanari chivalry and the native Hafling knack for mercantilism. While an unlikely combination, it proved a fruitful one.                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| [[Obitarium]]        | Aureliana | On the contrary, it seems that anything that dies in that land rises once more, with everything from small rodents to great beasts prowling across the land in various states of decay.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| [[Batari]]           | Aureliana | Long have the northern reaches of Aureliana been the home of the Goliaths of Bartari, a proud and noble people. They inhabit the frigid and harsh lands of the far north beneath the dancing lights of the stars.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| [[Vellig]]           | Ellanor   |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| [[Mentae]]           | Aewin     | Mentae was a center for learning and hosted numerous scholastic orders and academies. The greatest was The Circle, a renowned college dedicated to pursuing the arcane.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| [[Elysian League]]   | Aewin     | With the prestige and legitimacy this brought her fledgling state, she transformed a loose coalition of cities into a grand and unified republic.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| [[Kiseret]]          | Aewin     | Kiseret is a constellation of minor fiefdoms and upstart princedoms that nominally make up one unified state. However, their supposed unity has never stopped them from squabbling and bickering.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| [[Castanar]]         | Aewin     | Castanar has long stood as a bulwark of Chivalry on the western coast of Aewin. Its monarchy derives legitimacy from an alleged descent from the Lady of the Lake, a mythical figure central to the Castanari religion.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| [[Arcus]]            | Aewin     | Arcus was an old center of faith, with numerous temples, oracles, and holy sites spread across the province.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| [[Paktt Skydda]]     | Aewin     | Paktt Skydda , is a dwarven clan located near the Stenmur Gate. In fact along with clans of Batari the ancestors of Paktt Skydda forged it. It is the knowledge and skills of the very rune-smiths who forged inscribed the stones of the gate that has been passed down to the Skyddan clan today.Calor                                                                                                                                                                  |
| [[Calor]]            | Aureliana | The Kobolds of Calor have flourished far beneath the halls and holds of the Dwarves. They built a unique lifestyle that relied on the flow of molten rock to do everything to fuel their industry to heat their homes. However, the Kobolds were forced to venture out of their homes when the pools ran cold.                                                                                                                                                            |
| [[Atla]]             | Aureliana | Atla is not a conventional kingdom, dictatorship, republic, aristocracy, or even nation. Instead, it is a culture or way of life. The people of Atla are not governed by a central authority but rather by the community around them.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| [[Arzyl]]            | Aureliana | Arzyli's history is filled with internecine squabbling, with each clan vying for power and influence. For much of time, this took the form of raids, wars, and cold Arzyli blood flowing aplenty. However, this changed when one clan managed to subjugate all the others, forging an empire through subterfuge and trickery.                                                                                                                                             |
| [[Nylus]]            | Ellanor   | Nylus is in many ways the opposite of Virdia and, in many others, her twisted sister. While in Virdia, your senses are heightened to hedonistic bliss, in Nylus, they are sharpened to bring dismal isle into better relief. The land is nearly barren, with dusky gray earth and sparse stubborn vegetation. It's also terribly flat, with little scenery beyond dust. Flat, except for a single towering cluster of mountains huddling together in the island's center. |
| [[Brevi]]            | Aewin     | Brevi's ambitions are not in the conquest of territory but in the collection of wealth. Following the ancient unification of the elven clans of the region, they declared neutrality in all external conflicts. This peace allowed Brevi to focus on internal development.                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| [[Patkana]]          | Aewin     | Beneath the palaces of the Kiseret on the cavern floor of the Southern Spine sits the Commune of Patkana. While the Batkin were blessed with flight, the Ratkin (Or, more formally, Patkany) were blessed with an innovative spirit. As a result, many a Patkana clansmen have risked their lives upon some inane invention, with roughly equal amounts of succeeded and failed attempts.                                                                                 |
| [[Beluir]]           | Ellanor   | Beluir once ruled over nearly the entirety of Ellanor. The Empire planted its banner on almost every island of the sea and much of the coast. The Yuan-Ti that called it home once enjoyed all the fruits of the world's riches. Once.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| [[Gunpowder Cartel]] | Aewin     | One of the only Dwarvish states in Aewin, the semi-unified clans of the Gunpowder Cartel maintain a stranglehold on their namesake, gunpowder. They are the sole provider of gunpowder in all of Aewin, with the armies of all Elysia, Mentae, Arcus, and numerous others relying on them to fuel their weapons.                                                                                                                                                          |
| [[Farran]]           | Aureliana | Rising straight from the sea, Farran is unique. Lacking the shores and flat land of any other civilization, Farran consists of a cluster of several towering stone pinnacles. Farran's people are also notable, entirely composed of winged species, primarily of Avian descent.                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| [[Mezari]]           | Aewin     | For millennia, the Mezari halflings traveled across the Sunken Sands in their massive dunestriders. They controlled the only overland route to bridge northern and southern Aewin. This meant that when pirates or great storms made sea trade untenable, only they could provide the hungry markets of the north with the bounty of the southern lands.                                                                                                                  |
