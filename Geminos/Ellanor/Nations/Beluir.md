## Description:

Beluir once ruled over nearly the entirety of [[Ellanor]]. The Empire planted its banner on almost every island of the sea and much of the coast. The Yuan-Ti that called it home once enjoyed all the fruits of the world's riches. Once.

Before the collapse, Beluir was the center of all trade and wealth in Geminos, with ships patrolling every waterway, merchants plying every port, and soldiers extorting taxes upon a third of the population of all the land.

The home island itself was the most splendorous place in the world, with riches from every nation collected there. Palace complexes stretched for miles, with massive hedge mazes shaped in to mimic the coils of their god. None could compare to that of the Emperor, however. The imperial palace is a sprawling estate seated in the center of the capital city. From there, upon the Coiling throne, the Oracle Emperor would read the will of their god and make proclamations to determine the lives of millions.

This, however, was generations ago. Today Beluir is a fragment of its former glory. It barely rules over half of its home island, and with every scrap of money and material going to the war effort, the palaces and monuments that covered it in ages past lay rotting. The collapse was sudden and swift, for a decade a great storm ravaged the oceans. This left every imperial province isolated, with each garrison cut off from reinforcements and supply. The imperial fleet was either forced to stay in harbors, or worse lost at sea. The emperor themself drowned, with their heir going missing. 

The provinces have all broken away from the empire's grasp, with one now seeking to usurp Beluir itself. The Aven isle of [[Farran]] has risen, overthrowing the imperial garrison and even managing to launch an invasion. A tenuous peace was recently established, ceding much of the old heartland, and denouncing any claims to the rest of the empire. However, it is an uneasy one, with each side using it to attempt to recoup enough strength to end the other.
