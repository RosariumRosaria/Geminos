## Description:

Despite furious debate from theologians and historians alike, none can say why in the wastes of Obitarum, the dead tend not to remain restful. On the contrary, it seems that anything that dies in that land rises once more, with everything from small rodents to great beasts prowling across the land in various states of decay.

Some legends speak of a time when Obitarum was a beautiful land dotted by breathtaking vistas and stunning forests. Perhaps some arcane art of necromancy was taken too far, maybe some Dwarven hold dug too deep, or perhaps an ancient god viewed the inhabitants with displeasure. Regardless of whether the tales are true, that time is long past. Little grows in Obitarum's blighted wastes, leaving the land barren and hollow.

Long considered more of an oddity than anything else, the undead there have recently seemed to gain uncanny coordination, and the lands of the dead have begun to spread ever further. In recent years they even have broken through the arcane wards of the [[Stenmur Gate]]. This disaster has granted them access to both the Dwarven Holds of the [[Northern Spine]] and to the lands of the [[Batari]]

In modern days the only group to voluntarily venture into Obitarum are the [[Living Saints]], with all others hoping to avoid them at best and contain them at worst.
