## Description:

While the gnomish people can be found scattered throughout many of the kingdoms of [[Geminos]], their homeland is Vellig. 

Vellig was long a province of [[Beluir]]. However, unlike many of the imperial fragments, Vellig did not have a day of retribution when the empire fell. No, instead when the emperor stopped paying the local garrison, The Velligi governor stepped in. And as such, without a single drop of blood or clash of swords, Vellig won her independence. 

Vellig was blessed with huge reserves of gold, with Velligi mints providing the capital for much of the worlds nations.
