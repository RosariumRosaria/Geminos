## Session Summary:

Nico did some light shopping and befriended the local shopkeep [[Dimitris Rokas]]. He then questioned a former member of [[Retalis]]'  gang, and learned much about his methods. In specific Morgana was able to learn that they used batkin magic that dominated the mind.

Nico then made himself and Rhamnus disguises, and the party then set off to investigate the library. After breaching the library and locking a few doors the session ended.
