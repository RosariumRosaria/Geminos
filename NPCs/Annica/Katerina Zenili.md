## Description:

Born in the small town of [Annica], Katarina was fated for little more than being a humble farmer or fisher. Before the unification of the [[Elysian League]], the town was a little place in a minor duchy. She lacked formal education or any prospects. Her parents were simple leatherworkers.

However, she developed a fascination with the past. Annica stood amongst the skeletons of an ancient empire. All around her, there were ruins of the [[Elysia|Elysian Empire]], the aqueducts still ran past the two (Though they had long since run dry), and there even was an ancient imperial library sitting just a few miles away. She would spend days exploring its vastness as a child, reading the inscriptions and surviving scrolls, learning about how big the world could be outside her home.

She yearned for adventure and would do anything to have it. In her young adult life, she survived by pawning off the relics and riches she found to the local duke, though her earnings could not finance the globe-spanning journeys she imagined. Finally, she struck luck after annexing her home into the League, with [[Astaria]] bringing Elysian culture back into vogue. The papers and scrolls she loved went from worthless to priceless overnight.

She received a large grant to delve into the library, with her work bringing back advances in medicine, architecture, and culture. She could go across the League and even beyond, exploring remnants of the past as far afield as [[Kiseret]].

Today she has taken up residence in her hometown, using her vast riches to construct a cozy estate. But unfortunately, a tragic accident left her maimed and unable to use one of her legs; her days of adventure are sadly over.

## Visual Description: 

She's remarkadly short for an elf, standing at around 5'1. Despite her small stature, she strikes an imposing figure, with sharp features, dark eyes, brown hair and pale skin.
