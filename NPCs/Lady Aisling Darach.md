## Description:

Aisling Darach was not born a Queen. She was not born a Duchess, Countess, or even a Lady. She was simply a child with loving, if common, parents. She was not destined for greatness, but she certainly found it. 

She grew up in a small village next to a large lake and lived a simple and ordinary life there. She fished, swam, and helped out on the farm. She played games of make-believe, pretending to be a great knight and taking on quests of epic proportions. Her weapons were sticks, and her armor was leaves and vines wrapped tightly around her. She fought against the fearsome beast that really was just a log or the terrifying sea creature that was just a rocky outcropping in a pond. These games of valor won her the admiration of someone that watched from afar.

After a calm and normal childhood, she entered adulthood and was forced into excellence. After a falling star, a terrible creature emerged from the crater. Although, at first glance, it was great boar, at a second look, it shattered the mind, for it was full of impossible angles, colors that were not, and writhing mouths. It was not a boar. It tore across the land, leaving horror and death in its wake. 

When it reached her village, it left nothing. Only poor Aisling survived. When she awoke, she found herself floating in the lake, gasping and drowning. She saw the shore and swam with every bit of strength left to her. When she arrived, more than half dead, back on dry land, she realized something startling. She had not swum back home but was on a small island. One that had not been there before. This was her last thought before drifting back into that gentle blackness of dreamless sleep.

She awoke to a woman standing over her, a woman who was the entire grandeur of the night, burning with stars brighter than the sun. After a few confused blinks, she was a simple (if beautiful) elven woman. She offered her a hand and asked how she had arrived on her island. After a confused and scattered retelling of the last few days, the Lady took pity on the woman and nursed her back to health. Soon, she offered her a gift. She would give her a spear to kill the beast in exchange for an oath. 

Aisling swore herself immediately, swearing to honor the [[Lady of the Lake]], to follow wherever she led. This promise, as all promises did, pleased the Lady. Accordingly, she was gifted a simple but well-made spear, an oaken handle, and an iron point. It had carvings of vines across the shaft, which sprung forth into living ivy when held. With it, she hunted down the not-boar and numerous other creatures that had risen from the crater. 

After each quest, her devotion to the Lady grew, and the Lady's favor for her did in turn. She was given armor, a crown, a throne, a kingdom, and eventually, the Lady's hand in marriage. By then, she knew that the Lady was not an elf, or a human, or even a person. But she loved her still. The last gift the Lady gave her was a child.

Aisling is revered to this day as the first of the [[Knights-Errant]] and the first Queen of All [[Castanar]].



## Visual Description:

She was tall, with pointed elven ears (though, at birth at least, she was not an elf) and fiery red hair resembling autumnal leaves. She had numerous scars from completing her oaths and a kind smile.
