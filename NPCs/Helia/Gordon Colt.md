## Description:

Is like, one head shorter than Helia Man's down bad Has been at the Main temple for a little longer than Helia, showed her around, introduced her to his friends n shit Just a sweet little guy, very brave when it comes to combat and has a good, sensible head on his shoulders - incredibly shy around talking about his feelings though, poor guy Was taken aback by Helia's attitude at first, now whenever she says something inappropriate/refuses to lie to be kind, he just snickers in a corn
