## Description:

Born to a goliath grandmother and a human father, she is considered small by the goliath majority in The Village™️. Despite her size being above average for a human, she's considered small by most of her goliath peers. She has always been fascinated by birds and has become skilled at training them for a variety of tasks, such as hunting and carrying messages.

As a child, Ellie suffered a leg injury that left her unable to walk for a while. Although she has since recovered, she still experiences discomfort and relies on a cane or walker to get around. This physical limitation has not stopped her from pursuing her passion for bird training and her desire to find a way to fly.

Ellie is also a crafty and artistic person, with a talent for creating beautiful and functional objects. In addition to her bird training, she has a wealth of knowledge about animal health and can act as a makeshift vet when needed.

Despite being one of the few humans in The Village™️, Ellie was quick to accept [[Concordia]] and has been Helia's best friend since childhood. When [[Helia]] returned with her new religion, Ellie was intrigued and eager to learn more.
