## Description:

As a child, she discovered her love for music and quickly became skilled at playing the violin. She was also known for being a team player, always willing to help others and work towards a common goal.

Michelle is a flirtatious person and has been known to make Helia blush on several occasions with her compliments and charm. She is also an incredible actress, with the ability to talk her way out of almost any situation. However, due to some trust issues, Michelle has a tendency to slip away when she senses things are going sideways.

While Michelle takes her tasks seriously, she doesn't always follow orders if she believes there is a better way to achieve the same result, even if the way itself is a more unorthodox way. She values honesty above all else and has a deep trust in Helia due to her brutal honesty.

Michelle is currently in a relationship with [[Haru Kairon]]. As a Cleric and Bard, Michelle uses her musical talents to inspire and heal others, spreading the teachings of [[Concordia]] wherever she goes.
