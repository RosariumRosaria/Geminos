## Description:
She has a tough exterior and a soft heart. They love listening to Michelle play the violin and spending time with kids, often telling them stories. Haru is incredibly fast on foot and on horseback, and loves to race. They tend to show physical affection in a playful, even violent way.

Despite their tough exterior, Haru has a strong love for dogs and is passionate about technical drawings and architecture. They were also one of Selina's favorite students. Haru has gone on multiple missions with Michelle.

His faith in Concordia is made all the greater thanks to the stories her mother would tell them, of how before the [[Concord Dawn]] the faiths of the region portrayed Tieflings as devils, tricksters, and others.
