## Description:

Torok was born with a path laid out for him. His father, mother, older brother, and grandfather all served in the renowned [[Cerna Guard]], admirably in service of the emperor, and it was expected he would do the same. For a long while, he did, serving first as a common soldier (and eventually even being promoted to officer); he fought in the front lines against the hordes of [[Obitarum]], as a joint effort with [[Rosaria]]'s [[Rose Guard]]. There he was part of the ultimately futile campaign to prevent the breaching of the [[Stenmur Gate]]

However, it was there that he received a promotion that would change his life forever. He was promoted to Quartermaster after a minor injury that took him off the front lines. He took to this like a fish to water, discovering he had a mind for logistics, supply, and a bit of black market haggling. Following his term ending, he took his pay and purchased a small shop in [[Iszap]], where he created a fortune within a few years. 

While the rebellion disrupted his business, it also allowed him to grow even ricch. Thanks to the plague and supply shortages, the demand for [[Orvoss (Herb)]] tripled overnight, while the supply dropped to a quarter of previous levels. So, while he was careful to (mostly) not price gouge, he did earn a lucrative government contract.
