## Description:


Katona's path to leadership was unexpected from the start. As the illegitimate child of an Azryli father and a human noblewoman from clan [[Iszap]], her future looked bleak. However, with determination and a desire to prove herself, she followed in her father's footsteps and joined the mercenary company, [[Skala]].

Katona's talent for leadership quickly became apparent as she rose through the ranks. Her unwavering resolve, compassion for her fellow mercenaries, and innate ability to control fire set her apart from the rest. When clan Iszap rebelled against the empire, both sides sought to hire Skala. Katona played a pivotal role in convincing the company to fight against the rebellion after learning of the devastating plague that the clan had unleashed. This brought her into conflict with her own mother.

After Skala emerged victorious in the conflict, the empire rewarded them by elevating them to nobility. Katona became an official knighted member of the newly founded clan Skala and has since served with distinction. She has dedicated herself to easing the suffering caused by the famine and plague that ravaged the land after the rebellion's defeat.
