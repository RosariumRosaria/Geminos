## Description:


Katona's path to leadership was unexpected from the start. As the illegitimate child of an human mercenary father and a Arzyli noblewoman from clan [[Iszap]], her future looked bleak as her mother disowned her practically on birth. However, with determination and a desire to prove herself, she followed in her father's footsteps and joined the mercenary company, [[Skala (City)]].  At the time, Skala was a small company, consisting of a few hundred men, woman in children. It was comprised mostly of Half-Arzyli.

Katona's talent for leadership quickly became apparent as she rose through the ranks. Her unwavering resolve, compassion for her fellow mercenaries, and innate ability to control fire (thanks to her being of the lineage of [[Azyar]]) set her apart.

When clan Iszap rebelled against the empire, both sides sought to hire Skala. Katona played a pivotal role in convincing the company to fight against the rebellion after learning of the devastating plague the clan had unleashed. Unfortunately, this brought her into conflict with her mother. Despite this, she fought nobly, even personally fighting against her mother's personal guard.

After Skala emerged victorious in the conflict, the empire rewarded them by elevating them to nobility. Katona became an official knighted member of the newly founded clan Skala and has since served with distinction. She has dedicated herself to easing the suffering caused by the famine and plague that ravaged the land after the rebellion's defeat. It is a tall task, but one she rises to with determination.
