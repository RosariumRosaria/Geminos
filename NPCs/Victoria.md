## Description:

Once a simple peasant girl, born in [[Sanctus]], a vision from a new goddess named [[Concordia]], sent her on a pilgrimage to the scarred lands of [[Obitarum]]. Following a long and perilous journey, she proved her faith and achieved Sainthood. It is said that a single passing touch of her hand could cure even the most gruesome of illnesses. 

Upon her return, kings, peasants, and many others flocked to her banner and converted to her faith. Her reign brought unity, both in religion and purpose. Today many others have followed in her footsteps, joining her to rise as [[Living Saints]] of Concordia. 

While she is 54 years old, her physical form ceased aging after her ascension 32 years ago.
