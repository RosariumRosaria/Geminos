## Description:

- She’s very socially awkward from growing up so sheltered and isolated from the outside world. She was breaking out of her shell when first traveling with Goose and Maximilien, however losing them to a Remorhaz reversed that
- Cheese Elitist
- Filled with a genuine drive and passion for exploration, adventure, and a need to learn more about the world. Born both from the tenets of the order, and isolated upbringing it created
- Afraid of losing those close to her, normally this pushes her to fight on but could cause her to shut down if she failed
- Loves animals of all kinds (had a pet snake growing up)
- Equally at home in a stuffy library as the wild frontiers. However, she can find social things overwhelming
- Loves tinkering with her tools and gear
- Finds the destruction of knowledge and learning abhorrent
