## Description:

Arcus arose from an old province of the [[Elysia|Elysian Empire]], which like many others, became independent kingdoms. 

Arcus was an old center of faith, with numerous temples, oracles, and holy sites spread across the province. As such, it boasts innumerable priests, paladins, and ancient cults. While a few different faiths find their home in Arcus, the primary one is the [[Old Faith]], with each of the twin goddesses having a massive temple city in the kingdom. Many lesser gods and goddesses of that faith also boast holy sites dotted across the land. 

Arcus finds herself in a proxy war with the [[Elysian League]], due to the Arcan policy of supporting the more aristocratic duchies in the region. Since the League's unification of Central Elysia, Arcus and the League have been engaged in border skirmishes that threaten to escalate into a real war.

A few centuries ago, after an unlikely marriage between the Grand Duchess of Arcus and the King-Enchanter of Mentae, the two became the Dual monarchy of Arcus-Mentae. This was a remarkable period of cultural and economic flourishing, with the unique combination of religious zeal and academic intellect proving a potent pair. However, what the bonds of love forged, ideology slowly wore away. 

Two twin princes, one raised in Arcus ([[Juliae]]) and the other in [[Mentae]] ([[Auriae]]), tore apart any remaining unity in a succession crisis some 50 years ago. This sparked a brutal civil war, which left each kingdom broken and weary, with many works of art and architecture being destroyed in the fighting.

When the dust had settled, each prince sat upon the throne of their home kingdom. But, unfortunately, their dispute had reignited a bitter rivalry. To this day, they remain locked in a long war that ravages the lands of both.
