## Description:

The Crown of Silver Vines was forged by the Fae smiths of [[Virdia]] at the command of the Lady. It was given to the first Queen of all Castanar, [[Lady Aisling Darach]], to mark her marriage to the [[Lady of the Lake]].  

The Lady enchanted it further, intertwining it directly with the land of Castanar. As such, the crown can grant great control over the plants and animals of Castanar, along with signifying legitimacy. Unfortunately, it has been lost following the death of [[Lady Ciara]], the last Queen of All Castanar.

## Visual Description:

The crown is forged from silver interwoven with living wood and ivy. It is said to mirror the seasons, with flowers coming forth in the spring, growing even more magnificent during the summer, turning red and orange like the setting sun during the fall, and becoming cold, barren, and austere during the winter.
