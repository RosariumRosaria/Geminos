## Description:

Theama once was worshiped as one of the Ten, the highest pantheon of [[Elysia]]. They are part of the Winter Trimuva under [[Twin Goddesses|Aureliana]].

Worshipers pray to them for good weather, foresight, and that time's turning will treat them kindly. 

They were once far more popular, but today are mostly relegated to backwater towns.
