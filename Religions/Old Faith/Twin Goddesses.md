## Description:

While technically two deities, rarely is one sister spoken of without the other. According to the priests and oracles of the [[Old Faith]], they were responsible for forging the entire land of [[Geminos]]. While they are both gods of creation, they are opposites in many ways.

Aewin is heat, fire, and the spark that fuels life. She is the nurturing rays of the sun that let spring bloom forth and the wildfire that clears out old growth. In all things, she causes change, with all the joys and tragedies that entails.

Aureliana is her opposite, cold, ice, and preservation. While her influence can stifle change and bring a bitter winter, it can also help preserve the food needed to live through that winter. 

According to the faithful who follow them, they gave their bodies to create the two continents of Geminos, with the spirit of each guarding the land. As such, the names of the two continents also come from them.
