## Description:

The Firstborn Pantheon is the informal title for the collection of deities and primordial beings that make up the official religion of [[Arzyl]].

Much like the how the [[Arzyli]] are a fractious people their deities are a hodgepodge mix. Each clan brought it's own folklore into the greater whole when they were conquered by the imperial dynasty. Generally speaking each deity in the pantheon takes the form of a progenitor being, an ancient figure that sired the first members of the a specific clan or lineage. While these nominally line up with the clans of Azryl, centuries of interbreeding have meant that it's not uncommon to see an Arzyli worshipping the progenitor of a different clan.

The gods of this pantheon can take the form of ancient dragons, massive lizard-like creatures, or even great turtles. The traits of these deities are passed down to today, with Arzyli generally taking on the appearance and aspects of their progenitor.
