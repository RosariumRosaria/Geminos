## Description:

Nihion goes by many names. They are known as the Emperor of the [[Uralkor]], the Creator of [[Kiseret]], the Carver of Caverns, the Giver of Laws, and the Forger of Magic. It is said that they have as many titles and crowns as there are Kisereti.

## Origin of Kiseret:

Despite being the foremost god in Kiseret, Nihion was the creator not of the world, for that was the reviled [[Luxa]], but instead, they are the creator of the caverns and shadows. Luxa had created a world of overwhelming light, so much so that the world was an undifferentiated blinding white expanse. Life wandered in confusion, without anything to guide it.

Nihion saw this was unjust and wrong, so they carved out the caverns and filled them with darkness. This created difference created, order, and created hierarchy. They shepherded those chosen few disciples into this haven, naming them the Kisereti. Nihion gave them many gifts, teaching them magic to bind the world to their will, teaching them law to bind themselves to Nihion's will, and for the first leader of Kiseret, they created [[Aldasa Nihion|a Crown Unlike Any Other]].  

## Founding of the [[Uralkor]]:

Nihion's fledging kingdom was prospering, but like all Emperors, Nihion needed heirs and subjects. To this end, they sought out [[Dyeus]] and wed her. The two had children, [[Desonia]] and [[Fulgris]]. These became the first of the [[Uralkor]], the All-Sovereigns. 

Nihion also beseeched [[Tor]] and [[Meri]], two unaligned gods, to remain neutral in the war against [[Luxa]], granting them titles and gifts. As such, many Kiserti also revere them, although they are not formally part of the [[Uralkor]]. 

## Visual Description:

Nihion is often depicted as a tall, slender figure cloaked in glittering shadow with an ornate crown. In addition, they are commonly shown holding an unbalanced set of scales, representing their role in creating inequality.
