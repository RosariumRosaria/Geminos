## Description:

Most faiths can trace themselves back to antiquity, founded in stories of a long-dead prophet and silent deity who spoke to them, but not so with the Concord Dawn. Instead, its prophet is living, and its goddess speaks.

The faith was founded when [[Victoria]] had a vision from the goddess [[Concordia]]. Her mission sent her on a pilgrimage to the scarred lands of [[Obitarum]]. Following a long and perilous journey, she proved her faith and achieved Sainthood. Today many others follow in her footsteps, taking the long journey and risking their lives to ascend to become one of the [[Living Saints]] like her.

Today the faith is practiced almost entirely within the Saintdom of [[Sanctus]], where the Saints are the primary religious and temporal leaders.

Concordia orders her followers to heal the ill, feed the hungry, and spread the word. Yet, despite these noble goals, the faith has fought wars of expansion against its neighbors and rapidly made many new enemies.
