## Description

The Living Saints are more than just members of the [[Concord Dawn]] who have shown great piety. They are those few who have undertaken a pilgrimage to the land of [[Obitarum]] and faced great dangers to ascend to Sainthood. It's unknown to the broader world what the pilgrimage entails, except that many an aspirant fails in their attempt.

For those that succeed, however, the blessing of the Goddess are many. They are given powers of healing, able to cure illness and heal wounds with a touch. Today the Living Saints act as the spiritual and governmental leaders of [[Sanctus]].

The first to take up that mantle was [[Victoria]], who received a vision from [[Concordia]]. This sent her on a pilgrimage to the scarred lands of [[Obitarum]]. Following a long and difficult journey, she proved her faith and achieved Sainthood.
