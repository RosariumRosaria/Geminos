## Description:

While many gods are ancient, Concordia is new. How she came to be unknown to all but the innermost circle of her Saints, with many others speculating that she was either always waiting for one worthy of her blessing, or that she was born into existence recently.

Her domains are healing, rejuvanation, life, nature, the sun, and light. Her followers are concerned with spreading the faith and healing the ill in equal measure.
