## Description:

The Lady's Code is less of a formal relgion, and more of a collection of fables, oaths of chivalary, and codes of ettiqute that govern the lives of all those in [[Castanar]]. 

While the folk relgion can vary wildly, it holds immense importance to the [[Knights-Errant]], who follow a canonized version of it supposedly passed down directly from the [[Lady of the Lake]].
