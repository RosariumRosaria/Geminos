## Description:

The Lady is, above all, the central figure in the Castanari religion. Nearly every fable begins with her giving a quest, knighting a valiant hero, gifting a sacred relic, or dictating some ancient code. 

She is supposedly a historical figure as well, being treated as fact in [[Castanar]] that she was and is real. In fact, according to tradition, she graced the first Queen of Castnar with a mighty spear to mark her favor and a child to be her heir.

Specific details of her appearance are fleeting and myriad. She might be tall and elven in one tall. She might wear dresses spun of the greens of spring's first bloom, inlaid with the golden sunlight caught in amber. In another, she might be otherworldy, imperious, and as large as the night sky. She is made of the ink of night, with her eyes the harsh light of too-bright stars. 

Her origins are also unknown. In one story, she was born on [[Virdia]], causing it to become the home of the fae. In others, she arrived there, coming from somewhere different from this world. Some whisper that she once had a lover who ruled over [[Nylus]].
