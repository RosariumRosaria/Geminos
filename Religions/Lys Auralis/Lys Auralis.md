## Description:


The Batari faith is an informal code known as the "Lys Auralis" which centers around the dancing lights seen in the skies above the far north. While interpretations differ from clan to clan, what is generally accepted universally is the belief in those lights being the afterlife, with those who live virtuous and noble lives being granted a second life in those flickering rays.

Many clans embrace the idea of a primordial deity of dark and light creating the world. This original god became two, one of light and one of the dark. This isn't a simple split between good and evil. It is believed that both are needed to achieve balance, with the world being a test to determine those who are ready to move on. Until one reaches their full potential, one must remain in cycles of life and death.

The gods of light and dark beget numerous others, filling out a pantheon of deities with domains like valor, ice, warmth, and even the sun. These can vary wildly, some being almost universal, whereas others are localized to a single village. The Faith is remarkably adaptive, taking on aspects and even gods from other religions.

When Batari traders went to the far southern reaches of [[Elysia]], they found it easier to trade if they "converted" to the [[Old Faith]]. To do so, they syncretized the deities of light and dark with the [[Twin Goddesses]]. This created a hybrid faith, which persists even to this day. In recent years, some have even converted to the [[Concord Dawn]], with the goddess of the dawn finding a new home in religion focused on light. There are also those hardline conservatives who believe any outside influence on their faith is a grievous  sin.

There are also numerous lesser deities or demigods. Many clans hold the belief that if one proves themselves to be particularly righteous, they will be hand picked by the deities. Rather than moving on to the next life, they will take on the burden of watching over the world, helping to Sheperd other souls out of the cycle.
